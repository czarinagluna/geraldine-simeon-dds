				<q class="review">I have been seeing Dr. Simeon for at least 12 years with complete satisfaction. She keeps my teeth clean and monitors my issues as well. I've sent friends to her and they were equally satisfied. What is more, she and her staff have always been pleasant and professional in all my dealings with the office. I recommend her heartily.</q>

				<q class="review">I've been seeing Dr. Simeon since 2005 when I lived in Brooklyn Heights. She's trustworthy and professional, she cleans my teeth well and never recommends anything unnecessary. I fully trust her opinions when it comes to my teeth. I moved to Manhattan in 2007 and I still go back to Brooklyn to see her. I recommend her 100%!</q>

				<q class="review">Dr. Simeon is a gem! A very reliable, thorough, and honest dentist that I've ever come across. I wouldn't bother looking for another dentist in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. I am so happy with the work she does.</q>

				<q class="review">I started seeing Dr. Simeon way back in 2008, which means she has been my dentist for 8 years. During that long stretch of time I have been completely free of cavities, gingivitis, or any other unsightly oral maladies. I attribute this span of perfect dental health to two things: a trusty electric toothbrush, and Dr. Simeon's amazing cleanings... If you are looking for a dentist in Brooklyn, give Dr. Simeon a try!</q>

				<q class="review">Dr. Simeon is a great dentist. She is very accommodating with her schedule. She is very fair with prices and accepts most insurance. She has Saturday hours and when she recommends oral surgeons, they come with high praise. Her assistant is also very nice and they try their best to make you feel as comfortable as possible.</q>

				<q class="review">I've been going to Dr. Simeon for several years now... Her office is in an apartment building, which is a little odd at first, but feels homely and comfortable. Also, Dr. Simeon has a gentle touch and is good with small mouths like mine<!--  (I've had dentists that are bad with small mouths and nearly choke me during appointments) -->. Overall, she's a great dentist and her office is in a nice neighborhood. Highly recommended.</q>
